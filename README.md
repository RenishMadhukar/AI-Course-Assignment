# AI Course Assignment Repository

Welcome to my AI course assignment repository. This repository contains all the code, datasets, and documentation related to the assignments I’m working on for my Artificial Intelligence course. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a central location where I store all files and resources related to my coursework and share them with my instructor.

## Repository Purpose

This repository is specifically created for the assignments and projects in my Artificial Intelligence course. It will contain:
- **Assignment Code**: All scripts and code files for completing course assignments.
- **Datasets**: Any datasets used or created as part of the course.
- **Documentation**: Notes and explanations for the assignments, detailing the work done and the AI concepts applied.
- **Final Outputs**: The results or reports generated from the assignments.

## Steps for Creating the Repository

1. **Creating My GitHub Account:**
   I already had an existing GitHub account, so I skipped the account creation process. However, if I were to create one, I would sign up on GitHub's website and follow their onboarding steps. I logged into my GitHub account and navigated to the "Repositories" section to begin creating a new repository.

2. **Creating the Repository:**
   - Once logged in, I clicked on the “New” button to create a new repository.
   - I named the repository **AI-Course-Assignment** to reflect its content and purpose clearly.
   - I added a short description about the repository’s focus on the AI course assignments.
   - I set the repository visibility to **Private**, as I needed to control access and ensure it was only available to my instructor and collaborators.
   - I initialized the repository with a README file so that I could provide more context about the repository and its contents.

3. **Inviting My Instructor:**
   After the repository was created, I navigated to the repository’s **Settings** tab and scrolled to the “Manage Access” section. Here, I invited my instructor by entering their GitHub username and granted them **Read** permissions. This ensured that they would be able to view the repository and all its contents but not make any changes.

4. **Challenges and Resolution:**
   - **Finding the Manage Access Section**: Initially, I had trouble locating the "Manage Access" section in the repository settings. It wasn’t immediately visible, and I had to dig into the settings a bit more. Once I located it under the "Collaborators and teams" heading, I was able to invite my instructor.
   - **Repository Name**: Deciding on a good name for the repository was also a challenge, as I wanted it to be clear, concise, and reflective of the project’s purpose. I ultimately decided on **AI-Course-Assignment**, which seemed like a straightforward and simple name.
